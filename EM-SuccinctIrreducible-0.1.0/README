EM-SuccinctIrreducible - external memory LCP array construction algorithm
=========================================================================


Description
-----------

This package contains implementation of the external memory LCP array
construction algorithm called EM-SuccinctIrreducible. The algorithm is
described in the paper

  Juha Karkkainen and Dominik Kempa,
  Faster External Memory LCP Array Construction.
  In Proc. 24th European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA), 2016.

The latest version of EM-SuccinctIrreducible is available at:
  http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/pads/



Compilation and usage
---------------------

2. Compile EM-SuccinctIrreducible using the provided Makefile

   $ cd src
   $ make

This will produce six executables that allow computing the (P)LCP array
of a given file sequentially and in parallel. For usage, run the
programs without any arguments. EM-SuccinctIrreducible relies on the
prior computation of suffix array and BWT for the input text. The
suffix array for big files can be computed e.g. using the pSAscan
algorithm, see https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/pads/pSAscan.html for
more details.



Terms of use
------------

EM-SuccinctIrreducible is released under the MIT/X11 license. See the
file LICENCE for more details.
