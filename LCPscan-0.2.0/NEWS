Changes in release 0.2.0

  - Added --distribute, --nocache and --test command line options
  - Optimized the runtime and space usage of radixsort
  - More careful allocation of RAM for the STXXL sorting/merging routines (which
    reduces the risk of having to perform additional rounds of EM sorting)
  - Modified the merging of LCP subsequences to almost in-place (within STXXL)
  - Added collecting and displaying more statistics about LCP values
  - Changed the default number of superblocks from 4 to 10
  - Expanded README
